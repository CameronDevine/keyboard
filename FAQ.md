#Frequently Asked Questions#

###Why does the keyboard not work until several seconds after its plugged in?###

When the microcontroller first starts up it is in its bootloader mode. This stops automatically after a couple of seconds.

###The keyboard does not seem to be working correctly, what is wrong?###

Because of the electrical components used for the keyboard it may have issues with USB 3.0 ports. If you use a USB 2.0 post and it is still not working, try plugging it in through a USB hub. This will normally fix the issue.
