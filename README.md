#Reprograming#

This keybaord is an Adafruit Trinket 5V with three button and missing a couple of LEDs. If you would like to try to reprogram the board, the webpage here will guide you through installing the necessary drivers. Once the correct drivers are installed and you are ready to program the board you need to activate it's bootloader. On the Adafruit Trinket there is a button supplied for this purpose. One way to activate the bootloader is to unplug the USB cable and plug it back in. This will start the bootloader for a couple seconds before the board enters its keyboard mode. The other meathod is to short the reset (Rst) and ground (Gnd) pins. This second method has the exact same effect as the reset button on the Trinket.
